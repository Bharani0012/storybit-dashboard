## AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5.1)**  
  Used as a coding assistant to speed up development, generate boilerplate, and provide suggestions during debugging.

- **GitHub Copilot**  
  Assisted with auto-completion of common patterns and basic TypeScript hints.

## How AI Supported the Development

### 1. Speeding Up Boilerplate
AI helped quickly scaffold:
- Basic component structures
- Initial Tailwind class combinations
- TypeScript interfaces

This reduced setup time so I could focus on project logic.

### 2. Debugging & Error Explanation
AI provided guidance for:
- PostCSS configuration issues  
- Tailwind v4 migration  
- Next.js 16 server component behavior  
- Hydration warnings and fetch patterns  

I applied the fixes and verified functionality.

### 3. Code Suggestions (Refined by Me)
AI proposed patterns for:
- Scroll animation buttons  
- Responsive layout improvements  
- Cleaner prop typing  
- API helper structure  

### 4. Manual Development Work
All core decisions, structure, and final implementations were written and adjusted manually:
- App Router folder layout
- Server-side TMDB integration
- Dynamic route behavior
- Styling consistency across components
- Fixing scroll bugs and UI polish
- Building the final movie detail page

## Summary
AI accelerated development but **did not replace actual implementation**.  
All logic, structure, and final code were reviewed, modified, and verified manually.
